# AttentionMonitoring
Performed image and video classification with a Convolutional Neural Network in Python 
using TensorFlow Keras.

Fine-tuned the top layers of a ResNet-152 model, pre-trained with the ImageNet dataset, to classify images, video clips and live video feed to determine whether the individual is paying attention.
